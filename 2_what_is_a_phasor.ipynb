    "A negative number is a *mathematical representation* of the opposite of a quantity. It is distinct from the number zero which represents the absence or lack of a quantity. You can have no fewer than zero apples. Similarly, you cannot have a negative quantity of dollar bills. However, if the quantity of dollars refers not to physical legal tender but to an accounting of how many units of currency you have at your disposal, then a negative quantity represents the opposite of having dollars at your disposal---that is, owing dollars. In addition to this representation, negative numbers offer:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A *notation*. By prefixing a regular number ($x$) with a minus sign ($-$), it becomes negative ($-x$).\n",
    "\n",
    "- A *way to make calculations straightforward*. A negative number is like a different kind of quantity on which arithmetic operations can be done by treating them accordingly; to subtract a negative quantity you add its positive counterpart, to multiply you multiply by the positive counterpart and negate the product, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, a phasor is a *mathematical representation* of a sine wave, in terms of its amplitude $A$ and phase $\\theta$. A sine wave already has a mathematical representation in the time domain with the notation $A \\sin (\\omega t + \\theta)$. However, while this representation makes calculations possible, it does not make them straightforward and does not have a concise notation. Representing sine waves in the phasor domain offers:\n",

As we will see in [Life With and Without Phasors](3_life_with_and_without_phasors.ipynb), working in the phasor domain allows you to write and solve AC circuit analysis equations more quickly and easily than working in the time domain. Working in the time domain requires writing and solving differential equations from scratch for each circuit, even though the differential equations and their solutions are similar from one circuit to another. It turns out that the calculations that can be done with phasors are the bare minimum calculations that must be done in order to solve an AC circuit.\n",

We can prove that the sum of two phase-shifted sine waves is another phase-shifted sine wave, and apply trigonometric identities to calculate it. However, the geometric approach is more intuitive. Consider that point $X$ of the first wave's triangle is at the origin of its two-dimensional space, and that the second sine wave is similarly formed at any moment in time by a second triangle $X'Y'\\!Z'$. If the two waves were added, then the second triangle would be translated such that its point $X'$ would be situated at the first triangle's point $Y$. Thus, the second triangle's point $Y'$ would have the coordinates $(X\\!Z + X'\\!Z', Y\\!Z + Y'\\!Z')$, representing the sum of the two waves. Similarly, if we were instead subtracting the second wave from the first, the point $Y'$ would have the coordinates $(X\\!Z - X'\\!Z', Y\\!Z - Y'\\!Z')$. Clearly, the addition and subtraction of the triangles by which sine waves are formed satisfies the properties of vector addition and subtraction."

They satisfy all the properties of complex numbers, including addition, subtraction, multiplication by a scalar, multiplication, and division (as we've just seen).

In answer to this, consider that the behavior of multiplying a complex number of unit magnitude by ${j}$ is identical to the behavior of differentiating a sine wave of unit amplitude with respect to time, as shown in the following diagram. Similarly, by reversing the diagram, the behavior of dividing a complex number of unit magnitude by ${j}$ is identical to the behavior of integrating a sine wave of unit amplitude with respect to time. So, instead of writing derivatives and integrals to model capacitors and inductors, we can simply multiply and divide by ${j}$.\n",
